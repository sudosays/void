* Void

#+begin_quote
"Let go your earthly tether. Enter the void. Empty and become wind."
--- Guru Laghima

Void combines two packages, [[https://github.com/larstvei/Focus][focus]] and [[https://github.com/joostkremers/writeroom-mode][writeroom]], to create a writing mode that
is devoid of all disctractions.

It is mainly built for Doom Emacs (using the doom themes), but should be okay to
work for your flavour of Emacs.

** Installation

With Doom Emacs:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! void
  :recipe (:host github :repo "sudoays/void"))
#+end_src

With MELPA (TBD).

** Customisation
